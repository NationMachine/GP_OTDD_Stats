Here you will find the codes used to generate the statistics and graphs for the article: Characterizing the feature space transformations produced by genetic programming using the optimal transport dataset distance


The files are separated into three folders, which are as follows:

clas_exp: Contains the files used for classification problems
reg_exp: Contains the files used for regression problems
global_exp: Contains the files used for the global analysis

Each folder contains the following files with the following prefixes:


_OTTD_m3gp (.csv): Contains the problem data.

_stas (.py): This is the code to generate the statistical metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and improvement calculation).

_p_stats (.py): This is the code to validate the statistical hypotheses (p, r, slope).

_graphs (.py): This is the code to generate the graphs for the levels, group, problem, and run.

The clas_exp and reg_exp folders contain the folders with the "_mats" (.mat) prefix, which contain the raw data for the classification and regression problems.

The "gen_arbol" file is also included, which is used to generate the trees for the models generated by M3GP.
