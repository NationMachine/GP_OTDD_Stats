# SUMMARY
Here you will find the codes used to generate the statistics and graphs for the article:

•	Leonardo Trujillo and Joel Nation, _Characterizing the feature space transformations produced by genetic programming using the optimal transport dataset distance, under review in IEEE Transactions in Evolutionary Computation_.

# ORGANIZATION
The files are separated into three folders, each one containing Matlab files (.mat) with the raw data for the classification and regression problems. These were generated with:

•	**GPLAB Toolbox**: a Matlab toolbox based on [GPLab](https://gplab.sourceforge.net) developed by Sara Silva. 

•	**M3GP**: a framework developed by Luis Muñoz, and used in the article [M3GP - Multiclass Classification with GP](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16501-1_7), code for M3GP found [here](https://github.com/LuisMuDe), which is based on **GPLAB**.

The folders also contain the "*gen_arbol*" file is also included, which is used to generate the trees for the models generated by M3GP. The folders are the following:

•	**clas_exp**: Contains the files used for classification problems 

•	**reg_exp**: Contains the files used for regression problems 

•	**global_exp**: Contains the files used for the global analysis

Each folder contains the following files with the following prefixes:
•	**_OTTD_m3gp** (.csv): Contains the problem data.
•	**_stas** (.py): This is the code to generate the statistical metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and improvement calculation).
•	**_p_stats** (.py): This is the code to validate the statistical hypotheses (p, r, slope).
•	**_graphs** (.py): This is the code to generate the graphs for the levels, group, problem, and run.

The _clas_exp_ and _reg_exp_ folders contain the folders with the "**_mats**" (.mat) prefix, which contain the raw data for the classification and regression problems.
